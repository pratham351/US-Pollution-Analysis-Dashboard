## U.S. Pollution Data Analysis Project
Air pollution involves harmful substances in the atmosphere that affect human health, the climate, and materials. This dataset includes daily data for NO₂, O₃, SO₂, and CO, with metrics like mean values, maximum values, and Air Quality Index (AQI).




This repository contains an analysis of air pollution data in the United States, focusing on the four major pollutants: Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂), Ozone (O₃), Sulphur Dioxide (SO₂), and Carbon Monoxide (CO). The project utilizes data from 2006 to 2010 to provide insights into the extent and distribution of pollution across various states and cities in the U.S.

## Project Highlights

- Dataset: Includes daily records of air quality metrics such as pollutant concentrations, maximum values, and Air Quality Index (AQI) for NO₂, O₃, SO₂, and CO.
- Interactive Visualizations: Features dynamic dashboards and slicers to explore pollution data by state, city, county, and date ranges.
- Geographical Mapping: Utilizes filled maps to visualize pollutant distributions across U.S. states.
- In-depth Analysis:
  - Identification of the top 10 states and cities with the highest pollutant levels.
  - Visualization of maximum pollutant values and AQI trends over the years.
  - Quarter-wise breakdown of pollution levels.

## Tools Used
- Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- Python/Excel: For preprocessing and analyzing the dataset.

## Key Outputs
1. Detailed pollutant-specific dashboards (Carbon Monoxide, Ozone, Sulphur Dioxide, Nitrogen Dioxide).
2. Synchronized slicers for date ranges and geographical locations.
3. Insights into high-pollution areas and trends over time.

## Repository Contents
- Analyzation (U.S Pollution).docx.pdf: Documentation of the dataset and analysis requirements.
- US_Pollution_Report.pbix: Power BI file with interactive dashboards and visualizations.
